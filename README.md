solving simultaneous equations in python using numpy.  
the program uses cramer's method to solve the equations.
we take the coefficents of each variable(like x, y, z) and the constants of the equation as input and then apply cramer's method 

working: 

first the program prompts the user for the number of equations. let's say the user entered 2 
then the program will prompt the user for the coefficents(in this case there will be two coefficents) if equation is 2x+3y=9 user will input(2 3)
first it will take the coefficents for the first equation and then the second. if equation is 4x+5y=30 user will input(4 5)

next the program will ask for coefficents of both the equations. in this case user will input (9 30) 

now the program will apply cramer's rule and will output the correct value of variables
